================================================================================
+ gh-572 Allow to translate toolbar title in fof.xml
+ gh-570 Pass the form to child, needed for parseFieldTags
+ gh-565 Fine grained caching control for controller tasks
~ InstallScript: use is_file / is_dir instead of JFile/JFolder
# [MEDIUM] gh-571 $rowId is not a monotonically increasing ID
# [HIGH] push() does not save relations of new items
# [HIGH] If you declared onBefore/onAfter Controller methods public FOF would erroneously treat them as tasks

FOF 3.0.2
================================================================================
~ Clear the OPcache when installing / updaing an extension as long as it uses Installscript
~ You can now use a folder called ViewTemplate in your extension to hold your view templates

FOF 3.0.1
================================================================================
+ Added Params service to the container to easily get/set the component's options
+ Added appropriate responses on CRUD json save
+ Color Field
+ Added parse_value attribute in the Model field. Allows for `[ITEM:fieldName]` replacement in rendered drop-down values.
+ Form Field Button, added listItemTask attribute for sending POST task in the JHtml grid.
+ Browse view: Only show Publish buttons in the Toolbar if the DataModel has an "enabled" field
+ Numeric field type
+ Added forceDelete method in DataController to always delete, never trash, selected record(s)
+ Added onAfterApplySaveError event in DataController when saving fails
+ Rebasing of relation after item creation
~ Use the 'as' parameter of the JDatabase API for the HasMany relation
~ Ip helper class: let the workarounds be disabled

# [HIGH] The "callable" type hint is not compatible with PHP 5.3
# [HIGH] DataModel reorder is non-deterministic when multiple records with the same ordering value exist in the same scope
# [HIGH] LayoutHelper: we aren't loading files from the layouts directory
# [HIGH] When a record is locked and cannot be unlocked it should not be saved regardless
# [MEDIUM] You couldn't create new records using HTTP verbs (e.g. JSON API)
# [MEDIUM] DataModel's automatic validation for INT columns with '0' default value was broken
# [LOW] Front-end rendering of XML forms results in a superfluous div when sidebar rendering is disabled.
# [LOW] InstallScript::_createAdminMenus didn't assign values for NOT NULL columns of the menu database table
# [LOW] AkeebaStrapper renderer would not access the session through the container
# [LOW] Json view would use getItemsArray() instead of get() thus not making use of eager loaded relations

# Typo: tdwith instead of tdwidth in Scaffolding
# Media field: did not take `directory` attribute into account
# Filter order and direction not passed correctly to the view
# Calendar field type, notice thrown when the format attribute was not defined
# InstallScript would screw up trying to remove post-installation messages resulting in removal not happening

! Rewritten FOF

Backwards compatibility notes
----------------------------------------
* FOF has been rewritten in version 3 and breaks b/c. Good news: you can have FOF 2 and FOF 3 run side by side thanks to
  the new version using namespaces. Please consult the documentation wiki in the GitHub repository for information on
  how FOF 3 works.

Note for older versions
================================================================================
 FOF 2 follows a different development cycle. This CHANGELOG contains entries for FOF 3 only.
