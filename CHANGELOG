FOF 2.3.5
================================================================================
+ Installation script: add support for post-installation messages in Joomla! 3.2 or later
# [HIGH] Joomla! doesn't understand Itemid sent as a POST query parameter, causing front-end FOFForm to effectively post to the home menu item

================================================================================
+ F0FUtilsUpdate will refresh the update site if Joomla!, in its infinite stupidity, has disabled it without notifying the user and without giving them a way to re-enable it.

FOF 2.3.0
================================================================================
* FOF 2.3.x will be the last minor version before FOF 3.0

+ Update helper to help you interact with the Joomla! extensions update
+ Database schema installer / updater / remover helper – takes database schema maintenance to the next level!
+ F0FUtilsInstallscript utility class to create extremely powerful component installation scripts without reinventing the wheel every time
# [HIGH] Redirections not working when format != 'html'

Backwards compatibility notes:
----------------------------------------
* FOF is now being developed separately from Joomla!. In order to avoid naming clashes we have changed the prefix of all
  FOF classes from FOF to F0F (F-zero-F). Moreover, the installation path changed from JPATH_LIBRARIES . '/fof' to
  JPATH_LIBRARIES . '/f0f' (again: that's f-zero-f). The same goes for the FOF_INCLUDED constant which is now called
  F0F_INCLUDED (again: that's f-zero-f). If you want to use this new version please remember to change these instances
  from FOF to F0F.
* Important: The fof.xml file HAS NOT changed its name!
* Important: You must install FOF with your extension as described in the documentation or using F0FUtilsInstallscript.

! JFormField changes in Joomla! 3.2 Beta 1 broke FOF form fields

Backwards compatibility notes
----------------------------------------
* Since Joomla! 3.2 Beta 1 JFormField comes with a magic __set method which drops
  property assignments of any property JFormField is not aware of. This means that
  in order for your custom fields to work you need to add the following two public
  variables in your custom field class:

	/** @var   FOFTable  The item being rendered in a repeatable form field */
	public $item;

	/** @var int A monotonically increasing number, denoting the row number in a repeatable view */
	public $rowid;

  Failure to include them will result in an error message when trying to use your
  custom field in a browse form.

Note for older versions
================================================================================
 FOF 2.1.rc3 is the first version of FOF shipped with Joomla! itself. Changes
