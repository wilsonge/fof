~ FOFModel::onBeforePreprocessForm explicitly passes the form object as reference. Please update your method signature to avoid PHP notices
~ FOFModel::onAfterPreprocessForm explicitly passes the form object as reference. Please update your method signature to avoid PHP notices

# gh-208 Title toolbar not shown in frontend
# gh-212 Wrong asset_id (0) saved in table after creating a new item
# gh-214 Wrong ACL permissions saved when using the rules field type
# gh-217 Now using the correct ACL privilege (core.create, core.edit, core.edit.own) when creating or modifying an item
# gh-217 Save toolbar button shows up even when you can't edit an item
# gh-219 The "rule" field assigns a bad asset parent node, making it impossible to work with a newly created asset-tracked item unless you are Super User
# gh-222 Fixed toolbar "save" button on record with asset tracking
# gh-225 Toolbar and View now will honor core.edit.own permission, too
# FOFTable will throw an exception if we’re trying to get the assetName without a value for the primary key
# Fixed table asset behavior, now you can delete a record even if there is no asset
# Fixed FOFTable::hit
# Fixed FOFTable::check in order to ignore the `hits` field while doing autochecks
# Fixed FOFTable::getData, only table fields are returned
# Fixed FOFTable::toCSV, only table fields are returned; plus null fields are returned as empty string
# FOFModel->name mistakenly contained the component name instead of the model name
# gh-230 Fatal error on time format if the JavaScript time format is used.
# gh-231 FOFModel::getHash would return a wrong hash with temp model instances
# gh-235 Wrong pluralisation / singularilisation by the inflector is specific few cases (also vastly improved Unit Tests for the Inflector)
# Itemid not respected in the front-end of the site, leading to display and functional issues

# JHtml::_('behavior.multiselect') must be loaded in Joomla 2.5 and for FOFRenderJoomla
# Unable to add component-specific behaviours to models
# Fix loadTemplate behaviour on J3+
# When the table cache reports a table as non-existent (e.g. the server failed to reply to SHOW TABLES) you had to clean the cache to see the table in FOF
! JFormField changes in Joomla! 3.2 Beta 1 broke FOF form fields

Backwards compatibility notes
----------------------------------------
* Since Joomla! 3.2 Beta 1 JFormField comes with a magic __set method which drops
  property assignments of any property JFormField is not aware of. This means that
  in order for your custom fields to work you need to add the following two public
  variables in your custom field class:

	/** @var   FOFTable  The item being rendered in a repeatable form field */
	public $item;

	/** @var int A monotonically increasing number, denoting the row number in a repeatable view */
	public $rowid;

  Failure to include them will result in an error message when trying to use your
  custom field in a browse form.

Note for older versions
================================================================================
 FOF 2.1.rc3 is the first version of FOF shipped with Joomla! itself. Changes
 prior to this (i.e. changes before October 9th, 2013) were not tracked in this
