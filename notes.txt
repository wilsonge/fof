Last update: November 17th, 2012 w/ Bootstrap 2.2.1


When importing a new Bootstrap release you have to:

• Rename bootstrap.css to bootstrap.less and add this at the top:
     .akeeba-bootstrap {
  and this at the bottom of the file:
     }
  then compile it with a LESS compiler such as SimpLESS

• Remove all .modal definitions; that conflict with Joomla!
