Setting Up Joomla and FOF
==========================================

When starting to build a simple FOF component the first place to start is a clean localhost with a supported Joomla installation (as of writing 2.5.x and 3.x). 
There is already good documentation at <a href="http://docs.joomla.org/Installing_Joomla">the Joomla docs</a> which specifies how to set up your environment for Joomla.
Once installed and in the administration backend we can then install the latest RAD library. Eventually we will package this into our component – but for now it’s easier to install this independently. Go to <a href="https://www.akeebabackup.com/download/official/fof.html">https://www.akeebabackup.com/download/official/fof.html</a> and then download the latest release of FOF. In this tutorial this is 2.1 (beta2). Simply download the zip and install it in the extension manger. If done successfully this will look like:
